Greetings!! 

This is my Portfolio, if you'd like to check out the React source code that makes it up...
Then wander on over to either my staging || development branches! 

branch/master => (you are here) This is my master branch where github pages hosts it's files after a build. 

branch/staging => This is where if my ideas stick, they get staged and ready for build to Master.  

branch/development => Where all my initial ideas and iterations happen!
